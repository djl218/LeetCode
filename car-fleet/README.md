<h2>853. Car Fleet</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p><code>N</code> cars are going to the same destination along a one lane road.&nbsp; The destination is <code>target</code>&nbsp;miles away.</p>

<p>Each car <code>i</code>&nbsp;has a constant speed <code>speed[i]</code>&nbsp;(in miles per hour), and initial position <code>position[i]</code>&nbsp;miles towards the target along the road.</p>

<p>A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it, and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed.</p>

<p>The distance between these two cars is ignored - they are assumed to have the same position.</p>

<p>A <em>car fleet</em> is some non-empty set of cars driving&nbsp;at the same position and same speed.&nbsp; Note that a single car is also a car fleet.</p>

<p>If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will&nbsp;still be&nbsp;considered as one car fleet.</p>

<p><br>
How many car fleets will arrive at the destination?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: </strong>target = <span id="example-input-1-1">12</span>, position = <span id="example-input-1-2">[10,8,0,5,3]</span>, speed = <span id="example-input-1-3">[2,4,1,1,3]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">3</span>
<strong>Explanation</strong>:
The cars starting at 10 and 8 become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 doesn't catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 and 3 become a fleet, meeting each other at 6.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
