<h2>1882. Process Tasks Using Servers</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>servers</code> and <code>tasks</code> of lengths <code>n</code>​​​​​​ and <code>m</code>​​​​​​ respectively. <code>servers[i]</code> is the <strong>weight</strong> of the <code>i<sup>​​​​​​th</sup></code>​​​​ server, and <code>tasks[j]</code> is the <strong>time needed</strong> to process the <code>j<sup>​​​​​​th</sup></code>​​​​ task <strong>in seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>You are running a simulation system that will shut down after all tasks are processed. Each server can only process one task at a time. You will be able to process the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> task starting from the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> second beginning with the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> task at second <code>0</code>. To process task <code>j</code>, you assign it to the server with the <strong>smallest weight</strong> that is free, and in case of a tie, choose the server with the <strong>smallest index</strong>. If a free server gets assigned task <code>j</code> at second <code>t</code>,​​​​​​ it will be free again at the second <code>t + tasks[j]</code>.</p>

<p>If there are no free servers, you must wait until one is free and execute the free tasks <strong>as soon as possible</strong>. If <strong>multiple</strong> tasks need to be assigned, assign them in order of <strong>increasing index</strong>.</p>

<p>You may assign multiple tasks at the same second if there are multiple free servers.</p>

<p>Build an array <code>ans</code>​​​​ of length <code>m</code>, where <code>ans[j]</code> is the <strong>index</strong> of the server the <code>j<sup>​​​​​​th</sup></code> task will be assigned to.</p>

<p>Return <em>the array </em><code>ans</code>​​​​.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,2,0,2,1,2]
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Events in chronological order go as follows:
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.
- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using server 2 until second 3.
- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.
- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using server 2 until second 5.
- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.
- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> servers = [5,1,4,3,2], tasks = [2,1,2,4,5,2,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,4,1,4,1,3,2]
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Events in chronological order go as follows: 
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 1 until second 2.
- At second 1, task 1 is added and processed using server 4 until second 2.
- At second 2, servers 1 and 4 become free. Task 2 is added and processed using server 1 until second 4. 
- At second 3, task 3 is added and processed using server 4 until second 7.
- At second 4, server 1 becomes free. Task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 9. 
- At second 5, task 5 is added and processed using server 3 until second 7.
- At second 6, task 6 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
