<h2>950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>In a deck of cards, every card has a unique integer.&nbsp; You can order the deck in&nbsp;any order you want.</p>

<p>Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.</p>

<p>Now, you do the following steps repeatedly, until all cards are revealed:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.</li>
	<li>If there are still cards in the deck, put the next top card of the deck at&nbsp;the bottom of the deck.</li>
	<li>If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1.&nbsp; Otherwise, stop.</li>
</ol>

<p>Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards&nbsp;in <strong>increasing order.</strong></p>

<p>The first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">[17,13,11,2,3,5,7]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">[2,13,3,11,5,17,7]</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order doesn't matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.
