# LeetCode
I started doing problems on LeetCode in 2020.\
When I first started, I didn't even know what an algorithm was.\
Now when I look back at how much I have learned, I gotta say:\
I sure am glad to have LeetCode in my life! :)

This is a collection of some of the LeetCode questions that I have solved.\
Also be sure to follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielleskosky/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanielLeskosky).\
I post solutions to challenging algorithm problems nearly almost every day.\
Follow me on [Medium](https://daniel-leskosky.medium.com/) and [DEV](https://dev.to/danielleskosky) too, so you read my latest blog posts.

Here are the problems that have detailed explanations on my [blog](https://www.danielleskosky.com/):
