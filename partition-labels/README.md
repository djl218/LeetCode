<h2>763. Partition Labels</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>A string <code>S</code> of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre><b>Input:</b> S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
<b>Output:</b> [9,7,8]
<b>Explanation:</b>
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>S</code> will have length in range <code>[1, 500]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>S</code> will consist of lowercase English&nbsp;letters (<code>'a'</code> to <code>'z'</code>) only.</li>
</ul>
